The "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 error means that your server is trying to serve a favicon (the small icon displayed in browser tabs) but cannot find the file. Here’s how to fix it:

1. **Add a Favicon**:
   - Create a favicon file. This is usually a small `.ico` file (16x16 or 32x32 pixels).
   - Place it in your static directory (often named `static` in Flask applications).

2. **Serve the Favicon**:
   If you’re using Flask, you can serve the favicon by adding a route:

   ```python
   from flask import send_from_directory

   @app.route('/favicon.ico')
   def favicon():
       return send_from_directory('static', 'favicon.ico', mimetype='image/vnd.microsoft.icon')
   ```

3. **Link the Favicon in HTML**:
   If you have an HTML template, link the favicon in the `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="{{ url_for('favicon') }}">
   ```

4. **Testing**:
   - Make sure your server is running.
   - Clear your browser cache and refresh the page.

After these steps, the 404 error for the favicon should be resolved. If you still encounter issues, let me know!
